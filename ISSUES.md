# Applications Issues

[Github Issues](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-oasis/issues)

The issues which we have currently seen in the application which we have developed are below:

-   _Error handling during Sign In and Sign Out_: No Errors are being shown when the Sign Up/Sign In fails.

-   _Upload Journal does not show updates_: Once the user uploads a journal, there are no updates on the screen which shows us the progress and completion of the upload event.
    This would cause confusion among the users and make them upload the journal multiple times.
