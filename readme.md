# Oasis Wellbeing - A Mental Health Application
## Project Description
Oasis is an interpersonal journaling application that uses the power of AI to link, connect, acquiesce, and remember your mental recollections and thoughts. Think of a guide that not only analyzes entries but provides a response that is much more palatable than Chat GPT. 

Oasis also provides the ability to give the AI context by allowing users to upload historical journaling content. Leveraging the content, the AI can create a “history” with that user improving the responses given on future queries or journal entries.

### <a id="frontend">Front End</a>

**React.js with Typescript** provides a wide variety of control over components. It provides for enchanced code readability and ensures that errors are easier to catch at compile time rather than runtime.This combination overall will lead to fewer bugs, an improved developer experience, and better collaboration among developers.

### <a id="backend">Back End</a>

**Hapi.js with Javascript** allows for scalable and secure web applications with minimal overhead and full out-of-the-box functionailty. Features such as secure defaults, which block error messages that may leak information, alongside validation, caching, and authentication support make it an ideal choice. Hapi.js also boasts a robust plguin system that allows developers to add new features and fix bugs at a fast pace.

### <a id="database">Database</a>

**PostgreSQL** is a free and open source relational database management system. Its wide range of features alongside its reputation as a very stable and reliable system make it the ideal solution for managing large scale projects in even the most demanding environments.

### <a id="servers">Servers & Load Balancing</a>

**Microsoft Azure** offers very reliable and easy to use tools that make building and launching web applications a breeze.

### <a id="api">API Services</a>

**Moleculer.js** is a fast and powerful progressiv emicroservices framework for Node.js. It is extremely scalable with built in load balancers and fault tolerance. It offers a robust event-driven architecture model and a variety of additional features and development tools which make it a veyr useful implementation.

### <a id="unit">Unit Testing</a>

**Jest** is a very popular JavaScript testing framework which is developed and maintained by Facebook. It has many built in tools for testing all kinds of different code and even supports parallel test runs to maximize performance.

### <a id="monitoring">Monitoring & Performance Tools</a>

**Grafana and JMeter** are both open source software with extensive application monitoring utility. Grafana will allow us to visualize, alert on, and understand our metrics no matter where they are stored. JMeter will allow us to measure our performance and load-test our web applications.
